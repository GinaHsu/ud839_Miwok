1. Main- LinearLayout
    4 TextView:
    numbers/ colors/  family/ phrases

2. app/source/main/restdirectory: There files control how the app appears on different devices.

   Resources can include xml files, images, and other madia files.

   res/ values

    colors.xml
        This defines the colors of our app, the app theme colors and the color associated with each category of the words.
    dimensions.xml
        file which contains dimensions such as the width and height values for our app. It also contains the list item height which we've here set to be 88 dp.

        <!-- Height of each list item -->
        <dimen name="list_item_height">88dp</dimen>

    strings.xml
        These are all the text strings that will appear to the user in the app and we put them in a single file so that we can easily translate the app into other languages.

    styles.xml
        Here we define the theme of the app and specify the theme colors. We also have the style for how a category should look and thats's why each category on the main screen of the app looks similar in terms of height, pedding, front size and more.
